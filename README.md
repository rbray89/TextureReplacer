TextureReplacer
===============

[GitHub page](http://github.com/ducakar/TextureReplacer)

TextureReplacer is a simple plugin for Kerbal Space Program that replaces
and improves textures. For now, replacing Kerbal (face and suits), skybox and
high-altitude planet textures is supported. Additionaly, this plugin enforces
trilinear texture filtering (i.e. smooth transitions between mipmaps) and
compresses uncompressed textures from `GameData/` that are loaded in RAM.

Special thanks to Tingle for Universe Replacer and therealcrow999 for testing
and benchmarks of my plugin. Studying Tingle's Universe Replacer code helped me
a lot when writing this plugin.


Directory Layout
----------------
The textures to be replaced should be put into
`GameData/TextureReplacer/Textures` and have the following names (plus
.tga/.png/.mbm extensions, of course):

    kerbalHead              // Kerbal head
    kerbalMain              // IVA suit (veteran)
    kerbalMainGrey          // IVA suit (standard)
    kerbalHelmetGrey        // IVA helmet
    EVAtexture              // EVA suit
    EVAhelmet               // EVA helmet
    EVAjetpack              // EVA jetpack
    kerbalMainNRM           // normal map for IVA suit (standard & veteran)
    kerbalHelmetNRM         // normal map for IVA & EVA helmet
    EVAtextureNRM           // normal map for EVA suit
    EVAjetpackNRM           // normal map for EVA jetpack

    GalaxyTex_NegativeX     // Skybox -X
    GalaxyTex_PositiveX     // Skybox +X
    GalaxyTex_NegativeY     // Skybox -Y
    GalaxyTex_PositiveY     // Skybox +Y
    GalaxyTex_NegativeZ     // Skybox -Z
    GalaxyTex_PositiveZ     // Skybox +Z

    suncoronanew            // Sun corona
    moho00                  // Moho
    Eve2_00                 // Eve
    evemoon100              // Gilly
    KerbinScaledSpace300    // Kerbin
    NewMunSurfaceMapDiffuse // Mün
    NewMunSurfaceMap00      // Minmus
    Duna5_00                // Duna
    desertplanetmoon00      // Ike
    dwarfplanet100          // Dres
    gas1_clouds             // Jool
    newoceanmoon00          // Laythe
    gp1icemoon00            // Vall
    rockymoon100            // Tylo
    gp1minormoon100         // Bop
    gp1minormoon200         // Pol
    snowydwarfplanet00      // Eeloo

* TGAs are recommended over PNGs since Unity fails to generate mipmaps for the
  latter.
* If only diffuse textures for Kerbals are replaced but not normal maps, the
  stock normal maps are kept.
* Replacing only normal map is not supported.
* The planet textures being replaced are the high-altitude textures which are
  also used in the map mode and in the tracking station. When getting closer to
  the surface, those textures are slowly interpolated into high-resolution ones
  that cannot be replaced by this plugin.
* Replacing normal maps for planets is not supported since it doesn't make
  sense as a planet's normal map must match its heightmap data.
